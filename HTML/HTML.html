<h1>All about HTML</h1>
<h2>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>HTML is used as one of the main building blocks of the web along with CSS and JavaScript</p>
<p>When you start a HTML document the first thing you do is declare the type of document (officially known as a document type declaration) using:</p>
<div class='code'>
<p style="margin-left: 10px">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Once you have declared the document type you are then ready to start coding in HTML.
The HTML code itself is contained within the tags:</p>
<div class='code'>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">&lt;html&gt;<br><br>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
</div>
<p>All the code between the angle brackets &lt; &gt; is known as a html elament most html elaments have an openging &lt;p&gt; and a closing &lt;/p&gt;
tag however some elaments such as the &lt;link&gt; tag are self closing</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The head elament contains information releating to the webpage and is used by the browser.<br>
it contains information such as the title of the page a link to the stylesheet which is written in css it may also contain a link to a font bank.<br>
here is an example header:</p>
<div class='code'>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">&lt;html&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&lt;head&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&lt;link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?faimily=Roboto:200'&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSS1.css"&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&lt;What is HTML and CSS</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">&lt;/html&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The title will appear in the tab at the top of the browser it is not actually shown as part of the webpage</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The acutal webpage content is contained within the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags.</p>
<p>Generally the first piece of text will be a heading headings are contained within the tags
&lt;hX&gt;some heading&lt;/hX&gt; where X is a number from 1-6 the number catagorises the type of heading
with one being the largest and most major and 6 being the most minor. see the examples below to see how
each title would look</p>
<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
<p>general text is contained with in the paragraph tags &lt;p&gt;some text&lt;/p&gt; for an example of
how it would look read this paragraph again.</p>
