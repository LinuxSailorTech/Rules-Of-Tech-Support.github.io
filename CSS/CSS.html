<h1>What is CSS</h1>
<h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
</div>
<div id='section1'>
<h3>Linking a stylesheet</h3>
<p>When you start a CSS document you do not have to declare the 
document type or put any special code
to start the document however in the html document you need to 
provide a link to the stylesheet like so:</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSS.css"&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Selecting an Elament</h3>
<p>In the CSS document a statement is started using a slector for example the code to select the
paragraph elaments in the html document would look like this</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>h1 {<br><br>}</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Adding Color</h3>
<p>however to style the code you need to put at least 
two things inside the body of the selector
the first attibute we will add to the selector is colour 
and it is added like so</p>
<div class=code>
<p>h1 {<br>  color: firebrick;<br>}</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You can also colour the background of an elament 
using the background-color option</p>
<div class ='code'>
<p>p {<br>  background-colour: lime;<br>}</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Colours in CSS</h3>
<div>
<p>There are four ways of defining a clouour in CSS
The first way which you have already come accross is using named 
colours of which there are 147 the second is using RGB values rangeing
from between 0 and 255 the third is to use a hexadicimal color codes 
(more on those later) and the last way is using HSL colours.</p>
</div>
<div id='rgb'>
<p>Here is an example of setting colour values using RGB</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {<br>  color: rgb(255, 0, 0);<br>  background-color: rgb(61,255,255);<br>}</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id='hex'>
<p>Hexadecimal colour codes are another way to specify colour
as they offer a huge range of colours (16,777,216) to be exact
however unlike rgb colours that are specified in base 10 hexadecimal 
colours are written using base 16 so for example #000000 is black and
#ffffff is white.<br><br> An advantage of using this colour scheme is 
that only two characters at most are ever needed per colour and the 
order of the colours is the same as the rgb scheme (the # at the start
identifies it as hex code colour) it also means that if the colour
is made of the same characters it can be abbreviated like so #ff0<br>
<br>
here is an example of setting colour values using hexidecimal code</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {
  color: #3d3dff;
  background-color: #ff0;
}</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id='hsl'>
<p>HSL stands for Hue Saturation and Lightness<br>
Hue is What we understand as colour and is represened on what is 
known as a color wheel and can take any value betweeen 0 and 360<br>
Saturation is the amount of gray in a colour and is a percentage 
between 0% and 100% with 0% being gray and 100% being full saturation
(no gray)<br>
lightness is the amount of white in a colour it is a percentage with
0% being black 50% is normal and 100% is white</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {
  color: hsl(182, 20%, 50%);
  background-color: hsl(300, 100%, 40%);
}</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Font Formatting</h2>
<div id='text1'>
<h3>Font Family</h3>
<p>You can change the font family using the 'font-family' property as
in the example below</p>
<div class='code'>
<p>h1 {
  font-family: Garamond;
}</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Font Size<h3>
<p>Font size is measured in three units</p>
<div id='size1'>
<p>The First Unit is Pixels(px)</p>
</div>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {
  font-size: 32px;
}</p>
</div>
<div id='size2'>
<p>The Second Unit is Ems ems are a relative unite of measurement as
it changes the size of the text relative to the size of the elaments
size of text</p>
</div>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {
  font-size: 3em;
}</p>
</div>
<div id='size3'>
<p>The Third and final unit of font size is % which is also a relative
unit of measurement relative the the default text size of 16px so
for example if the size was set to 200% the size would be equivelent
to setting it to 32 px</p>
</div>
<div class='code'>
<p>p {
  font-size: 200%;
}</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Line Height</h3>
<div id='lh1'>
<p>The line-height property can also be set in either pixels or ems ems 
being the more preferable as it is relative to size of the text on the
page.</p>
